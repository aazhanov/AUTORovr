In order to run this start by initializing the Computer3_with_updated_node_navigation.py, that uses the haversine.py and is more or less self contained.
Make sure that you have serial ports enabled on the raspberry pi, the waveshare hat with a sim card installed and attatched to the Pi, and the antennas and GPS module properly connected.
The rover will start by first gathering its GPS information, so make sure you are outside and able to get a signal, once that is done, it will wait for connection via the app and pathfinding application.
Once that is done, control everything the rover does from the APP
